### Abstract
Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative condition that places increasing strain on patients, caregivers, and the healthcare system. Although early detection is vital, it is often limited by the cost and complexity of traditional methods such as neuroimaging and lengthy cognitive assessments. Identifying AD in its early stages can help preserve physical and social function, allowing timely intervention and continued engagement in physical activity, which supports quality of life and may slow disease progression. This model proposes a semi-supervised machine learning strategy for AD diagnosis based on acoustic features from brief speech samples. The approach takes advantage of mel-spectrogram features to extract vocal patterns without manual transcription or linguistic preprocessing. Informative sound patterns are detected using a convolutional neural network (CNN) that gradually adds unlabeled speech data during training through pseudo-labeling. By emphasizing scalable, non-invasive methods that rely solely on unprocessed vocal inputs, this work presents a practical solution for large-scale cognitive screening in resource-limited settings.
